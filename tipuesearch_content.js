Fibonacci Number","text":"Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/ Difficulty: Easy Question The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is, F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1 F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1. Given n, calculate F(n). Example 1: Input: n = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1. Example 2: Input: n = 3 Output: 2 Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Example 3: Input: n = 4 Output: 3 Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.

Inorder Successor in BST","text":"Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/inorder-successor-in-bst/ Difficulty: Medium Question Given the root of a binary search tree and a node p in it, return the in-order successor of that node in the BST. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null. The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val. Example 1: Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1 Output: 2 Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type. Example 2: Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6 Output: null Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.

Construct Binary Tree from String","text":"Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-string/ Difficulty: Medium Question You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers. The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure. You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists. Example 1: Input: s = \"4(2(3)(1))(6(5))\" Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5] Example 2: Input: s = \"4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))\" Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5,7] Example 3: Input: s = \"-4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))\" Output: [-4,2,6,3,1,5,7] Constraints: 0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104 s consists of digits, '(', ')', and '-' only.

Construct String from Binary Tree","text":"Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/ Difficulty: Easy Question You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way. The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair \"()\".

Example 1: Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4] 1 / \\ 2 3 / 4 Output: \"1(2(4))(3)\" Explanation: Originallay it needs to be \"1(2(4)())(3()())\", but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs.

Example 2: Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,null,4] 1 / \\ 2 3 \\ 4 Output: \"1(2()(4))(3)\" Explanation: Almost the same as the first example, except we can't omit the first parenthesis pair to break the one-to-one mapping relationship between the input and the output.
