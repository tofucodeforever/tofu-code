Champagne Tower","text":"Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/champagne-tower/ Difficulty: Medium Question We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row. Each glass holds one cup of champagne. Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top. When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it. When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on. (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.) For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full. After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full. After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now. After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below. Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.) Example 1: Input: poured = 1, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1 Output: 0.00000 Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty. Example 2: Input: poured = 2, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1 Output: 0.50000 Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange. Example 3: Input: poured = 100000009, query_row = 33, query_glass = 17 Output: 1.00000 Constraints: 0 <= poured <= 109 0 <= query_glass <= query_row < 100 Solution Just simulate how the pouring happens Here we create a tower with 100 rows just like the description This means we'd need to check if next row exists when pouring in the double for loop we can just query tower[query_row][query_glass] in the end For the pouring: think of all the glasses as left aligned in the 2d array, and the ones to pour into for [i][j] are [i+1][j] and [i+1][j+1] Code ''' Leetcode 0799.

Arithmetic Slices","text":"Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-slices/ Difficulty: Medium Question An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences. Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums. A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array. Example 1: Input: nums = [1,2,3,4] Output: 3 Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
