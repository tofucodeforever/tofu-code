Intersection of Two Linked Lists","text":"Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/ Difficulty: Easy Question Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null. For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node c1: The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure. Note that the linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns. Custom Judge: The inputs to the judge are given as follows (your program is not given these inputs): intersectVal - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is 0 if there is no intersected node. listA - The first linked list. listB - The second linked list. skipA - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listA (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node. skipB - The number of nodes to skip ahead in listB (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node. The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, headA and headB to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be accepted. Example 1: Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3 Output: Intersected at '8' Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B. - Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory. Example 2: Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1 Output: Intersected at '2' Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B. Example 3: Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2 Output: No intersection Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values. Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null. Constraints: The number of nodes of listA is in the m. The number of nodes of listB is in the n. 1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104 1 <= Node.val <= 105 0 <= skipA < m 0 <= skipB < n intersectVal is 0 if listA and listB do not intersect. intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB] if listA and listB intersect. Follow up: Could you write a solution that runs in O(m + n) time and use only O(1) memory?

Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list. The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x. For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively. Example 1: Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6] Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6] Explanation: The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below. Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red. We return the new list after removing this node.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue). Example 1: Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]] Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] Explanation: Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front. Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front. Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.

Sender With Largest Word Count","text":"Question Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/sender-with-largest-word-count/ Difficulty: Medium Question You have a chat log of n messages. You are given two string arrays messages and senders where messages[i] is a message sent by senders[i]. A message is list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. The word count of a sender is the total number of words sent by the sender. Note that a sender may send more than one message. Return the sender with the largest word count. If there is more than one sender with the largest word count, return the one with the lexicographically largest name. Note: Uppercase letters come before lowercase letters in lexicographical order. \"Alice\" and \"alice\" are distinct. Example 1: Input: messages = [\"Hello userTwooo\",\"Hi userThree\",\"Wonderful day Alice\",\"Nice day userThree\"], senders = [\"Alice\",\"userTwo\",\"userThree\",\"Alice\"] Output: \"Alice\" Explanation: Alice sends a total of 2 + 3 = 5 words. userTwo sends a total of 2 words. userThree sends a total of 3 words. Since Alice has the largest word count, we return \"Alice\". Example 2: Input: messages = [\"How is leetcode for everyone\",\"Leetcode is useful for practice\"], senders = [\"Bob\",\"Charlie\"] Output: \"Charlie\" Explanation: Bob sends a total of 5 words. Charlie sends a total of 5 words. Since there is a tie for the largest word count, we return the sender with the lexicographically larger name, Charlie.

The pointer should be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST. boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false. int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the pointer. Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number, the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST. You may assume that next() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be at least a next number in the in-order traversal when next() is called.

Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article): Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state.

The game consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future rounds' scores. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record. You are given a list of strings ops, where ops[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following: An integer x - Record a new score of x. \"+\" - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores. It is guaranteed there will always be two previous scores. \"D\" - Record a new score that is double the previous score. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score. \"C\" - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record. It is guaranteed there will always be a previous score. Return the sum of all the scores on the record. Example 1: Input: ops = [\"5\",\"2\",\"C\",\"D\",\"+\"] Output: 30 Explanation: \"5\" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5]. \"2\" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2]. \"C\" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5]. \"D\" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10]. \"+\" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].

Each glass holds one cup of champagne. Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top. When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it. When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on. (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.) For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full. After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full. After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now. After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below. Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.) Example 1: Input: poured = 1, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1 Output: 0.00000 Explanation: We poured 1 cup of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There will be no excess liquid so all the glasses under the top glass will remain empty. Example 2: Input: poured = 2, query_row = 1, query_glass = 1 Output: 0.50000 Explanation: We poured 2 cups of champange to the top glass of the tower (which is indexed as (0, 0)). There is one cup of excess liquid. The glass indexed as (1, 0) and the glass indexed as (1, 1) will share the excess liquid equally, and each will get half cup of champange.

Constraints: The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104]. -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000 Solution Use recursion to build the string while considering different cases of when to omit the parenthesis.
